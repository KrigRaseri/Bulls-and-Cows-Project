Bulls and Cows Game


This program plays the bulls and cows game where you try to guess a secret code. First, enter desired length of code, then how many characters on a range of 1-36 (0-9 and a-z) that the secret code may contain. The program will respond the number of entries are in the right spot (a bull), and number of entries that are in the secret code but   not in the correct spot (a cow). Getting all bulls means you guessed the secret code and win.
